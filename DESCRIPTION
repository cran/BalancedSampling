Description: Select balanced and spatially balanced probability samples in multi-dimensional spaces
    with any prescribed inclusion probabilities. It contains fast (C++ via Rcpp) implementations of
    the included sampling methods. The local pivotal method by Grafström, Lundström and Schelin (2012)
    <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01699.x> and spatially correlated Poisson sampling by Grafström (2012)
    <doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2011.07.003> are included. Also the cube method (for balanced sampling) and
    the local cube method (for doubly balanced sampling) are included, see Grafström and Tillé (2013)
    <doi:10.1002/env.2194>.
